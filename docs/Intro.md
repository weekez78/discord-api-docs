# Introduction

These developer pages document how to use Discord's API to empower your applications and create awesome bots for your
communities. All of our [documentation is on GitHub](https://github.com/discordapp/discord-api-docs) and we would
<3 corrections and improvements!

## Getting Help

If you believe you're experiencing a bug with our API or want to report incorrect documentation, open an issue on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/discordapp/discord-api-docs/issues).

For a more real-time avenue of communication, check out the [unofficial, community-driven Discord server for developers](https://discord.gg/discord-api). There you'll find community members who can help answer questions about our API, community libraries, bot creation, and other development questions.

## Applications (aka Apps)

Making an app on Discord opens up many possibilities for deeper integrations with your other services and platforms.
Here are some examples to whet your appetite:

- Using your Discord account to safely login to your guild's website
- Display who’s online or in-game on your website or forum
- Automatically join private Discord servers or gain new roles based on external website permissions
- Other neat things.

Head over to our new [applications page](#MY_APPLICATIONS/top) to dive into creating your own custom juice.

## Games (aka Games)

Discord is built around the idea of bringing people together through games. As part of that goal, we want to offer ways for game developers to work closely with us and make awesome stuff. [Rich Presence](https://discordapp.com/rich-presence) is a great way to more deeply integrate with Discord! It lets you:

- Show more detailed status information on your players' profiles
- Allow your players to create invites in Discord for others to play with them
- Launch into game sessions, parties, and groups directly from Discord
- Launch into your game's spectate mode directly from Discord
- Allow your players to ask to join their friends' games

Rich Presence is free, open-sourced, and self-serve, so check out [the How To guide](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_HOW_TO/) and get started!

Those looking to test out the waters before jumping into the deep end with a technical integration should check out our [Verified Servers](https://discordapp.com/verification) program. Being a game developer and owning and operating your game's Discord server makes you eligible for special perks like:

- A vanity url—no more `discord.gg/V913Lkm`
- Custom invite splash art
- Access to VIP voice server regions
- A verified check mark to show that you're legit

We can't wait to work with you and see what you make!
