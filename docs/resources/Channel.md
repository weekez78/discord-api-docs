If the message is generated by a webhook, the author object corresponds to the webhook's id, username, and avatar. You can tell if a message is generated by a webhook by checking for the `webhook_id` on the message object.

## Embed Limits

To facilitate showing rich content, rich embeds do not follow the traditional limits of message content. However, some limits are still in place to prevent excessively large embeds. The following table describes the limits:

###### Limits

| title | 256 characters |
| description | 2048 characters |

Returns a [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) on success, and a 400 BAD REQUEST on invalid parameters. Fires a [Channel Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/channel-update) Gateway event. If modifying a category, individual [Channel Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/channel-update) events will fire for each child channel that also changes. For the **PATCH** method, all the JSON Params are optional.

###### JSON Params

| Field | Type | Description | Channel Type |
|-------|------|-------------|--------------|
| name | string | 2-100 character channel name | All |

## Delete/Close Channel % DELETE /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}

Delete a channel, or close a private message. Requires the 'MANAGE_CHANNELS' permission for the guild. Deleting a category does not delete its child channels; they will have their `parent_id` removed and a [Channel Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/channel-update) Gateway event will fire for each of them. Returns a [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) object on success. Fires a [Channel Delete](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/channel-delete) Gateway event.

>warn

## Get Channel Messages % GET /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages

Returns the messages for a channel. If operating on a guild channel, this endpoint requires the 'VIEW_CHANNEL' permission to be present on the current user. If the current user is missing the 'READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY' permission in the channel then this will return no messages (since they cannot read the message history). Returns an array of [message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object) objects on success.

>info
>The before, after, and around keys are mutually exclusive, only one may be passed at a time.

###### Query String Params

## Create Message % POST /channels/{channel.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object}/messages

>warn
>Before using this endpoint, you must connect to and identify with a [gateway](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateways) at least once.

Post a message to a guild text or DM channel. If operating on a guild channel, this endpoint requires the 'SEND_MESSAGES' permission to be present on the current user. If the `tts` field is set to `true`, the SEND_TTS_MESSAGES permission is required for the message to be spoken. Returns a [message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/message-object) object. Fires a [Message Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/message-create) Gateway event. See [message formatting](#DOCS_REFERENCE/message-formatting) for more information on how to properly format messages.

The maximum request size when sending a message is 8MB.

>warn
>This endpoint supports both JSON and form data bodies. It does require multipart/form-data requests instead of the normal JSON request type when uploading files. Make sure you set your `Content-Type` to `multipart/form-data` if you're doing that. Note that in that case, the `embed` field cannot be used, but you can pass an url-encoded JSON body as a form value for `payload_json`.

###### Params

| Field | Type | Description | Required |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| content | string | the message contents (up to 2000 characters) | true |
| nonce | snowflake | a nonce that can be used for optimistic message sending | false |
| tts | bool | true if this is a TTS message | false |
| file | file contents | the contents of the file being sent | one of content, file, embeds (`multipart/form-data` only) |
| embed | [embed](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/embed-object) object | embedded `rich` content | false |
| payload_json | string | url-encoded JSON body used in place of the `embed` field | `multipart/form-data` only

>info
>For the embed object, you can set every field except `type` (it will be `rich` regardless of if you try to set it), `provider`, `video`, and any `height`, `width`, or `proxy_url` values for images.

###### Using Attachments within Embeds

You can upload attachments when creating a message and use those attachments within your embed. To do this, you will want to upload files as part of your `multipart/form-data` body. Make sure that you're uploading files that contain a filename, as you will need a filename to reference against.

In the embed object, you can then set an image to use an attachment as its url with our attachment scheme syntax: `attachment://filename.png`

For example:

```json
{
	"embed": {
		"image": {
			"url": "attachment://screenshot.png"
		}
	}
}
```

>warn
>Only filenames with proper image extensions are supported for the time being.
