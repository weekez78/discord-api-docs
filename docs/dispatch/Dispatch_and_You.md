# Dispatch and You

> danger
> The Discord Store is still in a beta period. All documentation and functionality can and will change.

If you're distributing a game on Discord, you'll need to send us the files! We quickly learned that email has a file size limit, and we ran out of carrier pigeons. Don't ask. Very touchy subject.

In light of those learnings, we built Dispatch! Great name, isn't it? _Dis_-patch? Anyway, Dispatch is your all-in-one uploader tool to get your builds, artwork, patches, DLC, and anything else onto Discord's servers. It's fast, easy to use, and I've been assured by our engineers that it's made of 100% farm-raised, cage-free, grass-fed code.

Dispatch will also be your tool for updating your store page on Discord while we work diligently on our new Developer Portal, which will provide you with a delightful way to manage your store page in the future. For now, keep that terminal handy, and get your developers' permission before pushing changes.

I mean, you don't actually _need_ their permission. But hey, a second set of eyes is always helpful, right?

Let's get you pointed in the right direction; follow this little Table of Contents to start, and you'll be a pro with this tool faster than you can say "But wait I don't actually know what a terminal is."

> To use Dispatch, you will need an application id for your game. You should have gotten this id when you set yourself up to use the Store SDK, but if not, ask a Discord team member to create an application for you and get you the id.
