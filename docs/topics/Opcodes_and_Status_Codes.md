# Opcodes and Status Codes

## Gateway

All gateway events in Discord are tagged with an opcode that denotes the payload type. Your connection to our gateway may also sometimes close. When it does, you will receive a close code that tells you what happened.

###### Gateway Opcodes

| Code | Name | Client Action | Description |
|------|------|------|-------------|
| 0 | Dispatch | Receive | dispatches an event |
| 1 | Heartbeat | Send/Receive | used for ping checking |
| 2 | Identify | Send | used for client handshake |
| 3 | Status Update | Send | used to update the client status |
| 4 | Voice State Update | Send | used to join/move/leave voice channels |
| 5 | Voice Server Ping | Send | used for voice ping checking |
| 6 | Resume | Send | used to resume a closed connection |
| 7 | Reconnect | Receive | used to tell clients to reconnect to the gateway |
| 8 | Request Guild Members | Send | used to request guild members |
| 9 | Invalid Session | Receive | used to notify client they have an invalid session id |
| 10 | Hello | Receive | sent immediately after connecting, contains heartbeat and server debug information |
| 11 | Heartbeat ACK | Receive | sent immediately following a client heartbeat that was received |

###### Gateway Close Event Codes

| Code | Description | Explanation |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| 4000 | unknown error | We're not sure what went wrong. Try reconnecting? |
| 4001 | unknown opcode | You sent an invalid [Gateway opcode](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/payloads-and-opcodes) or an invalid payload for an opcode. Don't do that! |
| 4002 | decode error | You sent an invalid [payload](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/sending-payloads) to us. Don't do that! |
| 4003 | not authenticated | You sent us a payload prior to [identifying](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify). |
| 4004 | authentication failed | The account token sent with your [identify payload](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify) is incorrect. |
| 4005 | already authenticated | You sent more than one identify payload. Don't do that! |
| 4007 | invalid seq | The sequence sent when [resuming](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/resume) the session was invalid. Reconnect and start a new session. |
| 4008 | rate limited | Woah nelly! You're sending payloads to us too quickly. Slow it down! |
| 4009 | session timeout | Your session timed out. Reconnect and start a new one. |
| 4010 | invalid shard | You sent us an invalid [shard when identifying](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/sharding). |
| 4011 | sharding required | The session would have handled too many guilds - you are required to [shard](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/sharding) your connection in order to connect. |

## Voice

Our voice gateways have their own set of opcodes and close codes.

###### Voice Opcodes

| Code | Name | Sent By | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| 0 | Identify | client | begin a voice websocket connection |
| 1 | Select Protocol | client | select the voice protocol |
| 2 | Ready | server | complete the websocket handshake |
| 3 | Heartbeat | client | keep the websocket connection alive |
| 4 | Session Description | server | describe the session |
| 5 | Speaking | client and server | indicate which users are speaking |
| 6 | Heartbeat ACK | server | sent immediately following a received client heartbeat |
| 7 | Resume | client | resume a connection |
| 8 | Hello | server | the continuous interval in milliseconds after which the client should send a heartbeat |
| 9 | Resumed | server | acknowledge Resume |
| 13 | Client Disconnect | server | a client has disconnected from the voice channel |

###### Voice Close Event Codes

## HTTP

Our API will return semantically valid HTTP response codes based on the success of your request. The following table can be used as a reference for response codes it will return.

###### HTTP Response Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 200 (OK) | The request completed successfully |
| 201 (CREATED) | The entity was created successfully |
| 204 (NO CONTENT) | The request completed successfully but returned no content |
| 304 (NOT MODIFIED) | The entity was not modified (no action was taken) |
| 400 (BAD REQUEST) | The request was improperly formatted, or the server couldn't understand it |
| 401 (UNAUTHORIZED) | The `Authorization` header was missing or invalid |
| 403 (FORBIDDEN) | The `Authorization` token you passed did not have permission to the resource |
| 404 (NOT FOUND) | The resource at the location specified doesn't exist |
| 405 (METHOD NOT ALLOWED) | The HTTP method used is not valid for the location specified |
| 429 (TOO MANY REQUESTS) | You've made too many requests, see [Rate Limits](#DOCS_TOPICS_RATE_LIMITS/rate-limits) |
| 502 (GATEWAY UNAVAILABLE) | There was not a gateway available to process your request. Wait a bit and retry |
| 5xx (SERVER ERROR) | The server had an error processing your request (these are rare) |

## JSON

Along with the HTTP error code, our API can also return more detailed error codes through a `code` key in the JSON error response. The response will also contain a `message` key containing a more friendly error string.
